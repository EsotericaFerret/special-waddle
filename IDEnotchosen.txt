I chose not to use JGRASP as I am familiar with how to use IDE's and would prefer to have the greater fuctionality of a more complex IDE. 
IntelliJ, on the other hand, I chose to pass on simply because it only works for Java.
Exclipse and Netbeans only issue is one shared by all the others, which is that I am simply unfamliar with their use.
